# React UI

This is a simple (really really simple...) react ui with a chart to compliment the test data generator.

To run this you will need to install nodejs - I recommend doing this using `nvm` https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. Follow the guide to install the relevant versions of node for this web app to run.

Most of this is boilerplate - the important bit (for now) is in `App.js`.

## Versions tested

I suspect this will work with newer versions but these are the versions that I had installed at the time.

node == v8.12.0, npm == v6.4.1.

## Dependency installation

Navigate to the directory containing the `package.json` and run

```
  npm install
```

This will install your dependencies. To start the app in dev mode run:

```
  npm start
```

This will build and serve the web app and allow hot reloading (rebuilds on saving).

## Chart library used

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-charts

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
